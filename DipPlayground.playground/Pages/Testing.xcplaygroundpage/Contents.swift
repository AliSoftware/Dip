### Testing

Dip is convenient to use for testing. Here is s simple example of how you can write tests with Dip.

__Note__: That's a very simple example just to demostrate use of Dip in tests, not how you should or should not tests your code in general. 
You can learn more about testing based on state verification vs behavior verification [here](http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html).

Instead of the real `Service` implementation, provide a _fake_ implementation with test hooks that you need:
*/

class FakeService: Service {
    var doSomethingCalled = false
