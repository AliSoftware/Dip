           You _should_ use this method only to resolve dependency with more runtime arguments than
           _Dip_ supports (currently it's up to six) like in the following example:
   
   ```swift
   public func resolve<T, A, B, C, ...>(tag: Tag? = nil, _ arg1: A, _ arg2: B, _ arg3: C, ...) throws -> T {
     return try resolve(tag: tag) { factory in factory(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...) }
   }
   ```
   
   Though before you do so you should probably review your design and try to reduce the number of dependencies.
