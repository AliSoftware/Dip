 Use this wrapper to identify _weak_ properties of the instance that should be
 auto-injected by `DependencyContainer`. Type T should be a **class** type.
 Otherwise it will cause runtime exception when container will try to resolve the property.
 Use this wrapper to define one of two circular dependencies to avoid retain cycle.
 
 - note: The only difference between `InjectedWeak` and `Injected` is that `InjectedWeak` uses 
         _weak_ reference to store underlying value, when `Injected` uses _strong_ reference. 
         For that reason if you resolve instance that has a _weak_ auto-injected property this property
         will be released when `resolve` will complete.
 
 Use `InjectedWeak<T>` to define one of two circular dependecies if another dependency is defined as `Injected<U>`.
 This will prevent a retain cycle between resolved instances.

 - warning: Do not define this property as optional or container will not be able to inject it.
            Instead define it with initial value of `InjectedWeak<T>()`.
